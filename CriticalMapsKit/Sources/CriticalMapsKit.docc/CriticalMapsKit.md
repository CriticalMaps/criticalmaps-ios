# ``CriticalMapsKit``

Modules and components used to build the Critical Maps iOS app

## Overview

The application is built in a hyper-modularized style. 
This allows to work on features without building the entire application, which improves compile times and SwiftUI preview stability. 
Every feature is its own target which makes it also possible to build mini-apps to run in the simulator for preview.
