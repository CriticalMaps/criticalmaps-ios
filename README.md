## What's "Critical Mass"?

> Critical Mass has been described as 'monthly political-protest rides', and characterized as being part of a social movement.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)

## What's this app?

This iOS app is made for Critical Maps. It tracks your location and shares it via a map with all other participants of the Critical Mass bicycle protest. You can use the chat to communicate with all other participants.

## Where can I get the app?

- **iTunes:** https://itunes.apple.com/app/critical-maps/id918669647
- **TestFlight:** https://testflight.apple.com/join/nyGeQVxk
- **Website:** https://criticalmaps.net

## Project Setup

The App uses Apple's `Combine.framework` for operation scheduling. The UI-Layer is built with [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and `SwiftUI`.
Minimum platform requirements are: iOS 15.0

### Modularization

The application is built in a hyper-modularized style. This allows to work on features without building the entire application, which improves compile times and SwiftUI preview stability. Every feature is its own target which makes it also possible to build mini-apps to run in the simulator for preview.

### Getting Started

This repo contains both the client for running the entire [criticalmaps](https://itunes.apple.com/app/critical-maps/id918669647) application, as well as an extensive test suite. To get things running:

1. Grab the code:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/criticalmaps/criticalmaps-ios
    cd criticalmaps-ios
    ```
2. Open the Xcode project `CriticalMaps.xcodeproj`.
3. To run the client locally, select the `Critical Maps` target in Xcode and run (`âŒ˜R`).

### Assets

The project is using type-safe assets generated with [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen).
If you add images to the project be sure to install it and run `swiftgen` from the root folder and add the changes to your PR.
